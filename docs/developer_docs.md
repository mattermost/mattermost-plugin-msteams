## Setup

- [Microsoft Azure Setup](./azure_setup.md)

## Connecting to MS Teams

There are two methods by which you can connect your Mattermost account to your MS Teams account.

- **Using slash command**
    - Run the slash command `/msteams-sync connect` in any channel.

    - You will get an ephemeral message from the MS Teams bot containing a link to connect your account.

    - Click on that link. If it asks for login, enter your Microsoft credentials to connect your account.

- **Using the button in the full screen modal**
    - If the setting "Enforce connected accounts" is enabled in the plugin's config settings, then a full screen modal appears that looks like this -

    - Click on the "Connect account" button.

    - A window appears containing a link to connect your account.

    - Open that link. If it asks for login, enter your Microsoft credentials to connect your account.

- **Connecting the bot account**
    - Run the slash command `/msteams-sync connect-bot` in any channel.
    - This command is visible and accessible by system admins only.
    - After running the slash command, you will get an ephemeral message from the MS Teams bot containing a link to connect your account.
    - Click on that link. If it asks for login, enter your Microsoft credentials to connect your account.
    - Refer [here](./docs/azure_setup.md#step-2-create-a-user-account-to-act-as-a-bot) for more details on connecting the bot account.

## Development

### Setup

Make sure you have the following components installed:  

- Go - v1.18 - [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/install)
    > **Note:** If you have installed Go to a custom location, make sure the `$GOROOT` variable is set properly. Refer [Installing to a custom location](https://golang.org/doc/install#install).

- Make

### Building the plugin

Run the following command in the plugin repo to prepare a compiled, distributable plugin zip:

```bash
make dist
```

After a successful build, a `.tar.gz` file in the `/dist` folder will be created which can be uploaded to Mattermost. To avoid having to manually install your plugin, deploy your plugin using one of the following options.

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. Edit your server configuration as follows:

```
{
    "ServiceSettings": {
        ...
        "EnableLocalMode": true,
        "LocalModeSocketLocation": "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket"
    }
}
```

and then deploy your plugin:

```bash
make deploy
```

You may also customize the Unix socket path:

```bash
export MM_LOCALSOCKETPATH=/var/tmp/alternate_local.socket
make deploy
```

If developing a plugin with a web app, watch for changes and deploy those automatically:

```bash
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make watch
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with credentials:

```bash
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):

```bash
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```
